# Image Segmentation Using Mask RCNN with OpenCV

In this repo, **image segmentation** is tested using **Mask RCNN**.
If an image is input, the model will segmentize into 90 classes. The class names can be check in the **mscoco_labels.names**
The model's result is still required to fine-tune on a specific dataset.
